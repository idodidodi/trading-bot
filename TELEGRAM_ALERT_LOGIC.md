# Telegram signal alert logic

Last reviewed: 2026-11-02.

This is the single reference for signal-alert behavior. This initial checked-in section documents dismissal and recovery; broader alert rules are not yet consolidated here. Local source behavior is distinct from verified production settings.

## Done/Undo dismissal and recovery


Personal alerts and shared alerts with group dismissal enabled use a server-side three-second grace period. Leaving a Telegram chat/folder does not cancel it. Pending deadlines survive worker restarts; dry-run pauses external effects. Personal callbacks require the enrolled user; shared-group callbacks require the matching message/chat.

After the grace period, Undo only acknowledges that the window ended; the listener handles deletion separately. Telegram's explicit `message can't be deleted` rejection (including its 48-hour deletion restriction) replaces the countdown with a completed/manual-delete notice and removes Undo. Already-missing messages count as deleted. Other API failures, including a failed fallback edit, keep the item pending with a persisted 30-second retry deadline. One failed item does not stop other pending deletions or callback polling. Database/ownership failures still propagate. Recovery applies to existing persisted pending messages when the updated worker runs; messages without recoverable database state are outside this repair. Production recovery has not been verified.
