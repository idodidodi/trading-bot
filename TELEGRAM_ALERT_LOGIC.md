# Telegram alert logic

Last reviewed: 2026-11-06.

## Chasing suspension

The owner requested cancellation of all chasing and use of its Telegram chats.
`chasing_runtime.CHASING_SUSPENDED` disables manual and automatic enrollment even
when an old `DIVERGENCE_CHASING_ENABLED=true` setting remains present. Signal
messages no longer attach Chase controls. Previously sent start, lookback and entry
buttons acknowledge suspension without changing state; authenticated exit reporting
for an existing position remains available.

The existing worker retires owner-owned, unentered `chasing` and `complete_first`
sessions as `expired`, clears their next deadline, cancels pending lookback and
increments their revision. It suppresses queued watch events. Telegram delivery
also gates the `chasing` and `crypto_auto_chase` routes, including rows loaded before
cancellation. No new cancellation messages are sent to those chats. Messages already
accepted by Telegram cannot be recalled by this suspension.

Demo execution rejects new `chase-4h-5m` intents. Existing submitted/open trades
continue reconciliation and exit management; RSI + PB execution remains separate.
Existing manually reported positions keep monitoring and position notifications.
This change does not close positions or send test orders. Original RSI, Pin Bars
and RSI + PB signal routing and qualification are unaffected.

The dashboard shows suspension notices and offers no chase activation or chat
registration controls. The original controls remain as explicitly archived
functions; the strategy engines, historical sessions and route registrations are
retained for future reference. No Telegram groups or messages are deleted.

Reactivation requires a reviewed change to the suspension constant, an explicit
review of preferences, chat destinations and execution policy, and regression
checks. Previously cancelled sessions and suppressed alerts must not be replayed.

`demo_execution.py` (`intent`), `web/app.js` (`chasingControls`,
`cryptoAutoChaseControls`, archived controls).

## Production verification

The source suspension is awaiting deployment. Following explicit owner approval,
production runtime cancellation was verified on 2026-11-06: all 140 unentered
chases were retired (156 expired including previous history), zero active or
completed-unentered chases remained, manual and automatic chase preferences were
off, and the demo entry policy retained only RSI + PB. The 317 sent messages and
historical groups were retained. Live-position notification preferences remained
on; there were no open demo trade records at verification. No test alerts/orders
were sent and the existing worker was not stopped for this cancellation.

## Done/Undo dismissal and recovery


Personal alerts and shared alerts with group dismissal enabled use a server-side three-second grace period. Leaving a Telegram chat/folder does not cancel it. Pending deadlines survive worker restarts; dry-run pauses external effects. Personal callbacks require the enrolled user; shared-group callbacks require the matching message/chat.

After the grace period, Undo only acknowledges that the window ended; the listener handles deletion separately. Telegram's explicit `message can't be deleted` rejection (including its 48-hour deletion restriction) replaces the countdown with a completed/manual-delete notice and removes Undo. Already-missing messages count as deleted. Other API failures, including a failed fallback edit, keep the item pending with a persisted 30-second retry deadline. One failed item does not stop other pending deletions or callback polling. Database/ownership failures still propagate. Recovery applies to existing persisted pending messages when the updated worker runs; messages without recoverable database state are outside this repair. Production recovery has not been verified.

## Colmex scanner integration

Local implementation (not yet production-deployed): `colmex_feed.py` connects the
scanner to the separate `colmex-mt4` package (`mt4/reader.py`). Colmex is a dedicated
primary provider with exact broker symbol identity, including `#`, and exchange
`Colmex-MT4`; no cross-provider fallback or assumed TradingView match is allowed.
The operator's 2026-11-06 UTC confirmation is recorded in `mt4/timezone-policy.json`.
Each read checks terminal/catalogue freshness, connection/configuration state, active
symbol and subscription revision, valid completed M1 OHLC, and live quote time.
Scanner integration supports 1h/4h/daily UTC aggregation. H4 starts at 00/04/08/12/16/20 UTC.
Only complete buckets in the most recent contiguous suffix are eligible. Missing
minutes or whole buckets reset that suffix; no market-break calendar is inferred.
The existing strategy minimum-history and first-scan baseline rules still apply.
Current SPX history only produced two eligible H4 bars in the read-only smoke test;
this does not meet strategy history requirements. Unknown gaps remain a readiness
blocker. Unavailable Colmex reads retry in 30 seconds. Other provider schedules remain.

`cloud/colmex.sql` exposes authenticated `/api/colmex` requests to installation
members (including viewers), with owner identity taken from auth.uid(), per-user
revision checks, 10 requested exact broker-classified catalogue forex pairs per user, and a 50-symbol
shared collection capacity. Removal works offline. No arbitrary owner IDs or paths
are accepted. `colmex_runtime.py` reconciles active members' requests plus enabled
configured assets under one exporter owner named `scanner`, preserving the existing
portfolio and other exporter owners. A separate bridge thread in the existing worker
refreshes requests/status every 30 seconds, independent of long scans; it emits no
signals or alerts. The scanner takes the reconciled request set at each scan start.
Revoked members cease contributing demand;
an explicitly disabled configured Colmex symbol takes precedence over requests.
Requested pairs are scanned as shared 4H forex assets using RSI, Pin Bars and RSI+PB.
Existing alert routing and personal category preferences apply: requesting a pair
is not Telegram enrollment and does not make its alerts exclusive to the requester.
Removing a request stops its contribution, not other users' or portfolio demand.
No Telegram chat command is introduced; subscribers use the authenticated Assets UI.

Verified locally: exporter live reload; reader/time-mapping/gap tests; authenticated
Postgres ownership, revision, offline removal and capacity tests; synthetic scanner
baseline and signal persistence; UI request controls. Tests use disposable data,
not production signals or Telegram delivery. Deployment requires the SQL migration,
package and worker configuration, and the hosted UI together. No production asset
selection or alert route has been switched by this implementation.
